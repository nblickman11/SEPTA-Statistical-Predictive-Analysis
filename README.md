# SEPTA-Statistical-Predictive-Analysis

The Exploratory Data Analysis code shows my exporation of a SEPTA train station csv file through pandas in Python.  
The data included variables assocaited with a number of customer complaints that SEPTA receives.

In the Phase 2 file, I perform statistical analysis and prediction modeling to draw insight on this data.
The code is pretty well commented to help understand the analysis.
